      "description": "This is a NIKON D40 digital SLR camera, with two lenses included: Nikon AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6 GII ED...and Nikon AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm 1:4-5.6 G ED (Auto focus is supported by the D40 system with AF-S lenses) These lenses are without blemish or scratches (see photos - zoom in!) Original Manual, Quick Start Guide, the battery charger, and carrying case are included.  Everything is in excellent condition because it was only used a few times, due to a long term illness of the owner (my wife).   I have included a lot of pictures.The original receipt is in the case also, showing a purchase price of over $800!  This is an older model, but remains a top quality SLR camera.  Truly an excellent value for a  modest price, and an inexpensive entry into the world of professional photography!",
