      "description": "We have more of these cameras than we need, so we’re letting one go at a price that’s right.  The Sony PMW-350 is one of the most popular professional camcorders Sony has ever produced.  It uses three 2/3” CMOS chips to produce a superb, richly-detailed image.  This unit has only 566 hours on it and comes with everything in the standard camera package and more…much more!  In addition to a Fujinon 16x1 autofocus/manual lens, camera plate, camera strap, stereo mic and color viewfinder, this package includes 3 Sony BP-GL65a V-mount lithium-Ion batteries (66 watt hours each…all in good shape), Sony BC-L70 battery charger/power supply with 4-pin cable, 4 Sony 32GB SxS cards (each holds a little over 100 minutes of footage at full resolution), Sony SBAC-US20 SxS card reader with USB cable, Sony ECM-680S stereo shotgun mic (sells for $799 new at B&H - sounds fantastic!).",
